# Peru-Electrical-and-Natural-Gas-System

This repository provides a new, openly available, test system that accurately models the integrated EPS and NGN system of Peru with high spatial resolution. We have developed this real-world test system using public information from the Peruvian ISO, the Peruvian Energy Commission and our first-hand work experience in the Peruvian energy sector.
